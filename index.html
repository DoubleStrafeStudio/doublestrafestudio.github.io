    Q: What is this website for? 
    Putting this website together to showcase projects I've completed during my learning journey
    to reflect my skills as a developer. Some of these projects are also meant to have actual users. The hope is that users
    may need a developer can discover my other projects/abilities and consider hiring me.

    Q: What are the skills I want to develop? 
    Create interactive web apps that help the users in some way, whether that's to help them keep up on college football recruiting, 
    help them plan their cooking times for following recipes, help them make purchasing/planning decisions for their custom mechanical
    keyboards, help organize their thoughts as they read through scripture, or even calculate their emissions for air permits. 

    Q: What's the point of developing these skills? 
    I wanted to explore a different career. I've spent 8 years as an environmental consultant and am not sure if it's something I want
    to do for the rest of my life. But regardless, this is a skill I want to learn. Although I was originally not that into the idea 
    of being a developer, the chance to create things that are functional and address needs through computation is pretty cool. I'm 
    not yet certain that every aspect of it is going to be fun, but I'd just like to explore it. 

    Q: Are you doing this full time? 
    Yes, I have quit my job as an environmental consultant to work on learning this full-time. 

    Q: What's your plan for learning?
    I'm going to go through the codecademy courses available to me and also build the projects listed above, plus anything else that 
    might make sense to fit into the learning plan. I am hoping that establishing a foundation through codecademy and gradually gaining
    experience through the project work will prepare me to land a job as a developer.

    Q: Isn't quitting your decent job just to learn how to code a little bit extreme?
    Well, I wanted to work on learning a lot of other things in addition to development. I'm interested in trying to learn how to cook 
    a lot of cuisines, finally becoming fit, diving into more theology and spending time in the Word and with God, improving my Cantonese
    and Korean, and either picking piano back up or getting better at art. 

    Q: How are you going to do each of those things? 
    For cooking, I'll dedicate a couple months to very specific cuisines to learn all I can about them and master recipes. I'll document 
    the journey and blog about it while practicing photography and figure out how to present the information to develop visualization skills.
    For becoming fit, that's mostly just down to establishing a morning routine of working out. I'm not trying to do anything crazy, but want 
    to develop a habit so that when I return to full-time work, I'll be more able to keep up with working out. 
    For growing my spiritual life, it comes down to also developing a morning routine to spend time in scripture, praying to God, and reshaping
    my perspective on my life and the world. Try to find ways to live out my faith and learn to depend on God. And then direct that experience outward.
    For improving Cantonese and Korean, I'll use an app to learn the language and seek to exercise speaking it more often. Get to a point where 
    I can watch content without subtitles. Not sure about the Cantonese, but for the Korean, will stick with LingoDeer for now. Supplement with some 
    other online resources. 
    Lastly, I'm probably going to lean towards art, but I'll do some exercises from time to time on learning gesture, figure, structure, etc. 
    Idk, this is very much a lower-priority goal for me. It's something I really want to learn, but not a very high priority in terms of 
    capitalizing on my time away from a full-time job.
